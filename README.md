## Forecasting EGX-30 Closing Index
# Introduction 
The stock market is a dynamic and unpredictable environment, making it challenging to predict stock prices. This project investigates the closing index of EGX-30 which is considered the most important index in the Egyptian stock market. Using different techniques such as the ARIMA model, deep learning techniques like neural networks, and machine learning techniques including Random Forest classification.

# Objective 
The primary objective of this research is to explore and compare the performance of different forecasting techniques in predicting the EGX 30 closing index. Also the paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of the ARIMA model, LSTM neural network, and Random Forest classifier in forecasting the EGX 30 closing index. Also, assess the strengths and limitations of each prediction method to provide insights for investors and financial decision-makers. Moreover, explore the potential of treating the stock market prediction task as a classification problem to reduce forecasting errors and provide more accurate investor predictions.

# Methodology 
In this project, a dataset starting from 2016 uptil February 2024 was used and split into training and test datasets. The training dataset starts from 2016 till the end of 2022, while the test datasest starts from the beginning of 2023 till Feb 2024. The study starts with a detailed description of  EGX-30 closing index, and performs a comprehensive descriptive analysis to understand the characteristics of it. Moving forward, the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model was employed to analyze the time series characteristics of the EGX-30 closing index, including stationarity, seasonality, and measures of accuracy. Also, the study utilizes a deep learning technique, specifically the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, to predict the EGX 30 closing index. The LSTM model is designed and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics. Then, we explored a machine learning technique, the Random Forest classifier, to predict the direction of the EGX 30 closing index. The model is constructed and evaluated using various performance measures. Last, a comparison was held to compare the performance of the ARIMA model, LSTM neural network, and Random Forest classifier in predicting the EGX 30 closing index. The strengths and limitations of each method are discussed, providing insights for investors and financial decision-makers.
